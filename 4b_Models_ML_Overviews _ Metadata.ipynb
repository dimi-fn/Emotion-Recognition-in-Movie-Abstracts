In the case of OvR, six binary classifiers should be trained, one for each emotion out of the 6 emotions, combining the six classifiers’ outputs as an ensemble method With OvO, a binary classifier should be trained for every pair of emotions, e.g. one classifier distinguishing the emotion “happiness”  from “sadness”, the other classifier distinguishing “happiness” from “anger” and so on.
